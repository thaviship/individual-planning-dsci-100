    "The percentage of total hours has been used as it allows to comapre how gameplay activity is distributed between subscribers and non-subscribers within each experience level. It normalises each group to 100% which prevent extreme values from distorting the comparison. Hence, the visualisation shows that subscription status is strongly related with higher gameplay hours. Across all experience levels, subscribers contributes the vast majority of total played hours which indicates that being a subscriber is one of the clearest predictors of heavy engagement. However experience level variable still plays a major role as the visualisation depicts that more advanced groups like Pro and Regular tend to show higher total hours but the dominant trend is that subscribers constently play more regardless of their experience category.

The predictors include gender, experience, and subscribe, which are categorical variables, and age, which is a numerical variable, all of which are dummy variables that regression can handle. Moreover, linear regression allows for an estimation of how each predictor variable is associated with changes in gameplay hours while controlling for other variables.\n",
